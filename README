README for MediaAlignedText
==================

What is MediaAlignedText?
-------------------------
The basic purpose of the MediaAlignedText project is to provide support in synchronizing audio/video playback with corresponding text.

The initial focus is an HTML5 audio player which has typical audio controls linked to time-aligned html text segments.  When each segment of audio is played, then the corresponding text segment is highlighted. Also, when a text segment is selected (e.g. by a click), then the audio player tracks to the aligned time.


Modules
-------------
Player:  The MediaAlignedText Player is a javascript library written as a jQuery plugin that handles the playback of aligned media and text in a web browser. All that is needed to use the player is the javascript library (including other javascript libraries dependencies), a publically accessible media file, and the html tagged version of text containing the alignment data.


Editor:  The MediaAlignedText Editor is a javascript library that extends the functionality of the MediaAlignedText Player by allowing the user to create and edit the alignment data linking the media and the text.


AutoAligner:  (proposed) The AutoAligner is a server side program that will take a media file and corresponding text and automatically create the html tagged text for use by the MediaAlignedText Player.
