README for MediaAlignedText
==================

What is MediaAlignedText?
-------------------------
The basic purpose of the MediaAlignedText project is to provide support in synchronizing audio/video playback with corresponding text.
The initial focus is an HTML5 audio player which has typical audio controls. Additionally the media files are time-aligned to corresponding text segments.  When each segment of audio is played, then the corresponding text segment is highlighted. Also, when a text segment is selected (e.g. by a click), then the audio player tracks to the aligned time.


Functionality
-------------
At it simplest, MediaAlignedText is merely a javascript library that handles the playback of aligned media and text in a web browser. In this case all that is needed to use the player is the javascript library (including other libraries dependencies), a media file, and the json-encoded alignment data connecting the media files to the text.

The additional functionality is for handling the generation, manipulation and storage of the alignment data in a database.  Also, since the this data lends itself well to audio book formats, there is a planned module which allows export and import from the Epub format.

PHP 5.3 + Mysql (for additional alignment generation, manipulation and database functionality)
